<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Spring Boot application that has 4 main entities: Albums, Songs, Artists. There is a One-to-Many relation between the Albums and Artist and a Many-to-Many relation between the Albums and Songs. The user can add, delete, update and search objects regarding these entities. The preexisting objects are added via 2 .sql files: one that adds the tables and the columns and one that add the information in the tables.
The database is a PostgresSQL database.</p>
<p>
In order to see the contents of the website the user has to log in, using the already made accounts, or they can make a new account.
</p>
<p>
If the user is logged in as a regular user, they can only see the already added Albums, Artists and Songs and search for a specific song.
</p>
<p>
If the user is logged in as an admin they can, besides the perks of a regular user, manage the entities by adding, deleting and updating them. 
</p>

- [x] controller test has a "_@AutoConfigureMockMvc(addFilters = false)_" that bypassed the security temporarily
<p>

</p>

  - **artistGenderIsMandatory()**
    - check that gender has to be specified when creating a new Artist
- [x] _AlbumServiceTest_ checks that you cannot change the name of an album that does not exist based on the ID

  - a _@BeforeAll_ setup that initialises a new User and a new Artist that will be used in _changeArtistNameShouldChangeTheArtistName()_ 
  - **changeArtistNameShouldChangeTheArtistName()**
    - checks if the update method from the Service layer actually changes the name of the Artist


### Create a docker container for the DB
```shell
docker build -t "music_db_image:Dockerfile" .
```

```shell
docker create --name music_db_image -p 5431:5432 music_db_image:Dockerfile
```

### Start the container:
```shell
docker container start music_db_image
```

### Check tests command
```shell
./gradlew check
```

<h4>Week 1 - Testing</h4>

  - **deleteArtistShouldReturnNotFoundForNonExistingArtist**
    - checks if trying to delete a non-existing artist by an id that doesn't exist is returning the status "not found"
  - **deletingASongShouldReturn404ForNonExistingSong**
- [x] _SongsControllerTest_  
    - checks if trying to delete a non-existing song by an id that doesn't exist is returning code 404

- [x] _ArtistRepositoryTest_  
  - **artistNameIsUnique** created 2 new artists that have the same attributes and checks to see if the name is unique by throwing a DataIntegrityViolationException exception
  - **artistGenderIsMandatory** checks if it's possible to create a new artist and insert the gender as null. To check if gender is mandatory, the test throws a DataIntegrityViolationException exception
- [x] _SongRepositoryTest_  
   - has a @BeforeAll that creates a new song by adding its name, duration and genre using the repository and fetching its id
   - then in the actual test, there are 3 new Song instances that get the song previously created by getting the name; each time spelled differently, and then tries to see if they match the song from @BeforeAll
   - in the end, the song is deleted from the DB using the id
- [x] _AlbumServiceTest_
  - check if a non-existent album can be modified by asserting it as false

<h4>Week 2 - Client</h4>
- [x] the Client project has npm, webpack and ESLint implemented
- [x] styling is done using Sass by using variables for the nav color, background and user messages and is imported using the index.js file
- [x] bootstrap is imported using the index.js file
- [x] nav bar menu items are done using SPA: by clicking on Search the title disappears, and the search bar is visible, and if you click on Add, the search bar is not visible anymore and the user can see the add form
- [x] the search and add endpoints were previously implemented in the Spring Boot's backend of the main project
- [x] they are implemented in the Client project using a fetch call
  - if there are no results and error message appears, otherwise there is the search result table
  - if the added form is not completed accordingly, the page remains the same; otherwise the user gets a message confirming that the object has been added succesfully
- [x] CSRF is disabled only for "api/albums"
- [x] CORS is enabled and corresponds to the Client application

<h4>Week 3</h4>

- [x] styling is done using Sass by using color variables and is imported using a site.js file in the fragment header to import it all over the html pages easier

- [x] the seeding is done using N-threads 
- [x] the single threaded seeder finds the records that start with the letter M and that debuted between 1940 and 2000 by getting them one by one using their id
